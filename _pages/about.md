Hey There!

I am a MS student at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech, USA. Presently, I am working in the domain of Human-Robot Interaction at Collaborative Robotics Lab (Collab) at Virginia Tech under the guidance of Dr. Dylan Losey .


I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering with minor in Robotics and Mechatronic Systems at here at Virginia Tech in 2022. During my Bachelors, I was working under the supervision of two undergraduate research teams, one under Dr. Erik Komendera within the FASER Lab and the other under Dr. Steven Southward with VT AutoDrive Team.

My research interests include Shared-Autonomy and the mixture of Human-Robot Control, and am forever looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in these ever-evolving fields.
